A minimalist, high-performance web application for a 4-star hotel to seamlessly manage and track its daily breakfast service.

Aurore is a streamlined application designed for a 4-star hotel to manage its daily breakfast service. The application provides an intuitive interface for front-of-house staff to check in guests by room number, preventing duplicate entries for the same day. It features a real-time dashboard displaying the number of guests served and a detailed list of checked-in rooms with timestamps. The system automatically handles daily sessions, resetting room statuses each morning. A comprehensive history module allows management to review and export reports from previous days for operational analysis. The entire experience is built on Cloudflare's edge network, ensuring instantaneous response times critical for a fast-paced restaurant environment.
